RMD file for processing and analyzing single cell data from SLE prone C57/BL6 mice (B6.Sle1.yaa from Jackson Labs). Germinal center B cells were 
selected and multiplexed before scRNA-seq processing and analyxix with 10X Genomics cellranger and presto/changeo pipelines. 

The RMD code consists of processing the cells from 2-3 mice at each timepoint, month 2 (before SLE onset), month 4 (SLE onset) and month 7 (severe SLE disease). 
The three timepoints underwent quality control and integration according to Seurat tutorials (before V5) and later analysis was performed after Seurat V5.
